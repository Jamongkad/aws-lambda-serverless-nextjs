# Getting Started

-   clone https://github.com/Prefinem/aws-lambda-serverless-nextjs
-   `yarn` and then `yarn start`
-   go to http://localhost:3000

# Notes

-   Making a change to react doesn't update the localhost url. You much build the app `yarn build` after you make a react change.
-   Static assets aren't done, or even close to done. API Gateway has issues with binary and non binary endpoints
-   This is work and progress and will probably lag behind as I work on it internally for work. I will opensource all changes here.
